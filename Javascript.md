## Tech debt

* `+` : used for both addition and concatenation. 

* `==` : only check value of number not datatype eg: '1' == true => true, "28" == 28 => true. 
* `===`(equality check)   checks the datatype first and then checks value
* typeof(null) => object : ideally it should return null by it returns object.
## Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on operands. following operators are used in JavaScript.

#### 1. Arithmetic Operators
| Operators         | Description |
|--------------------|------------- |
|+ |It is used to performs Addition. |
|-	 |It is used to performs Subtraction. |
|*	 | It is used to performs Multiplication. |
|/	 |It is used to performs Division. |
|%	 |Modulus. |
|++	 |It is used to performs Increment. |
|--  |It is used to performs Decrement. |

#### 2. Logical Operators

| Operators          | Description |
|--------------------|------------- |
|&& (Logical AND)    | If both the operands are true, then the condition becomes true.         |	
| Logical OR     |If any one operand are true, then the condition becomes true.|
|! (Logical NOT)     | It Reverses the state of operand. If a condition is true, then the Logical NOT operator will make it false.|


#### 3. Ternary Operator 

| Operators          | Description |
|--------------------|------------- |
|? : (Condition)|If Condition is true? Then it returns value A  : Otherwise value B|
